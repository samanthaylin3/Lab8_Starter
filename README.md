3. No, because this involves sending the message and then checking if the message went through and that it arrived to the recipent. This isn't a single block of code and requires checking several layers of the application at once.
4. Yes, because you are checking if the input is no more than the max characters allowed. You only need to check the block where it takes in the input and ensure sure the message is no more than 80 characters.
